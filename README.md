# COVID
This repository will attempt to tackle the COVID19 pandemic. Data will be collected from the Kaggle competition found here: https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks

The code requires that the data from kaggle is loaded into a directory name data in the base directory of the project.
